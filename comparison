* xml
** Advantages
1. More library support.
2. Memory required is less (Hardly relevant)
3. Supports STRUCTURED DATA FORMAT Language.
** Libraries
 UGGGHH! Many. Element tree looks good.

* yml 
Not technically a mark-up language.
** Advantages
1.   Easier to read and edit.
2.   Just like a data format.
3.   YAML was designed using Python, Perl, Ruby! All scripting languages.
4.   Supports STRUCTURED DATA INTERCHANGE FORMAT Language.   
** Libraries
1. Pyyaml : Python Parser (Suits our purpose)
2. Syck : More gen
* PyQt and yml 
PyQT4 is a binding. We can use the .ui files provided by QtDesinger <xml> and then add a python script to convert <xml> 
to yaml which is a lot more usable .
We could also try to ignore the xml file and generate our own yaml , which might not involve the QtDesigner advantages.
